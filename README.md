As of 13th of October, 2024, RaCoGen offers two modes to generate contexts:
Generate for a determined time in seconds or generate as many contexts as you
want. RaCoGen will guide you throught these steps and ask you what do you want
to do during this guide. After each generation, you will be asked if you want
to keep generating contexts or exit. You can keep generating contexts as long
as you want.

Also, it checks if a context has already been generated, so it won't save the
exact same context twice.

This is expandable if you need it to be, since you can manually modify the words
inside of the nouns, adjectives and actions database, which will increase the
total number of contexts that can be generated without duplicates.

The program generates 40 contexts per second in average and displays the exact
value after it's done generating.

I haven't checked exactly how many different contexts can be generated given the
3 databases I include in the repository, but I've been generating for a while
and can garantee that at least 25.000 different contexts can be added to your
database (the number could go even further, but, as I said, I haven't checked
the exact number).
