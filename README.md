As of 11th of October, 2024, "Random Context Generator" can only produce a random context using 3 different databases that are also there once you download this repository. 
The only thing you need to do to produce a context is double click the batch file named "Run_Random_Context_Generator". 
Once the program finishes this task, it will show you which noun, adjective, setting, action and context it selected and generated. 
It will stay open for as long as you want, waiting for you to press any key to close (you can also close it by clicking the x on the window, like you would do everywhere else). 
Right now, this program only does one context per run, and you have to manually save the context, if that's what you want, or run it again, if that's what you want.
